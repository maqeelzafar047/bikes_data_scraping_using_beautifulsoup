A year-wise motorcycle data scraping project using Python and BeautifulSoup.

## üìä **Overview**

This project collects motorcycle model data from **Bikez.com** for each available year using a custom-built web scraper. The data includes motorcycle brand, model, and related details, which is compiled into a single CSV file for use in analysis or machine learning applications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Tools & Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** ‚Äì for HTML parsing
- **Requests** ‚Äì for sending HTTP requests
- **Pandas** ‚Äì for working with structured data
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì for writing and testing code

---

## üîÑ **Workflow Breakdown**

### 1. **Import Required Libraries**

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
```

These libraries are used to fetch web content (`requests`), parse HTML (`BeautifulSoup`), and store the data in a structured format (`pandas`).

---

### 2\*\*. Fetch All Available Years\*\*

```python
base_url = "https://www.bikez.com"
years_url = "https://www.bikez.com/year/index.php"
html = requests.get(years_url).text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
year_links = soup.select(".col-md-6 li a")
```

The scraper visits the `year/index.php` page and extracts all links corresponding to available years for motorcycle models.

---

### 3. **Loop Through Each Year and Scrape Models**

```python
models = pd.DataFrame()
limit = 50

for year_link in year_links:
    year = year_link.text.strip()
    year_href = year_link['href']
    url = base_url + '/' + year_href
    html = requests.get(url).text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

    rows = soup.select(".list div")[:limit]
    for row in rows:
        model = row.text.strip()
        models = pd.concat([models, pd.DataFrame({"year": [year], "model": [model]})], ignore_index=True)
```

This part collects bike model data for each year. It limits the number of models per year (for testing or throttling reasons).

---

### 4. **Preview and Display Data**

```python
models.head()
```

This previews the first few rows of the collected data to validate the scraping process.

---

### 5. **Export Data to CSV**

```python
models.to_csv("bikes_data.csv", index=False)
```

The structured data is saved as a CSV file named `bikes_data.csv`, ready for further analysis.

## üìÜ Output Example

Sample output:

```
year      model
2023      Yamaha R1
2023      Honda CBR1000RR
...
```
